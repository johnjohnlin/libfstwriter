# High-Performance FST Waveform Writer

A C++14 re-implementation of the **Fast Signal Trace (FST)** waveform writer, originally designed for [GtkWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).

## 🚀 Overview

This project provides a highly optimized, standard-compliant C++ implementation of the FST writer API. The core of this project is written in **C++14** to ensure maximum compatibility with EDA tools and environments (which is usually a bit outdated), specifically targeting performance improvements for *Verilator* simulations.

The unittests are written in C++20.

### Key Features
- **C++14**: The core of this project is written in clean C++14 to maximize compatibility. Using `vector` and `string` can eliminate most resource management code compared to C.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed to reduce simulation overhead (2x faster than the original `fstapi` when used with Verilator). This is mainly because we process data as binary instead of strings used by the original `fstapi.c`.
- **Drop-in Compatibility**: Includes an optional C-compatible wrapper `fstapi.cpp`, providing the same writer interface as the original `fstapi.c`.
- **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests written in C++20 to ensure correctness. Coverage is also generated and checked (70% line and 70% function coverage).
- **Bit-true**: The implementation is bit-true to the original `fstapi.c` (tested in unittests).

## Regression Reports (WIP due to GitHub Actions permission issue)
We generate a detailed regression summary for every push on the `main` branch.
To view it:
1. Go to the **Commit Detail** page (click the **Commit SHA**, usually above the files list).
2. Look for a comment by `github-actions[bot]`.
3. Click the link "Click Here to View Summary". This takes you to the **Job Summary** page of the Action run, where you can see the pass/fail status and coverage metrics.

## 📂 Project Structure

Every file of this project is under the `src` directory, which also includes third-party files:

```
fstcpp/              # 🌟 MAIN: Core C++ implementation
├── Writer.h       #    - The new C++ API header
└─── Writer.cpp       #    - The implementation
gtkwave/             # 📚 ORIGINAL: Original GtkWave files
├── fstapi.cpp       #    - C-style wrapper for backward compatibility
├── fstapi.c         #    - REFERENCE: the original GtkWave implementation
└── fstapi.h         #    - The original GtkWave header file used by both fstapi.cpp and fstapi.c
integration_test/    # 🧪 TESTS: Integration tests generated by Verilator
```

## 🛠️ Build & Testing & Installation

### Prerequisites
* C++20 compatible compiler (GCC/Clang)
* CMake (3.10 or higher)
* Ninja (optional, recommended for speed)

### Setup for Development (VS Code)

To configure the project with debug symbols and prepare it for *VS Code*+*clangd*:

```bash
# Generate build files using Ninja
cmake -G Ninja -B build/debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug src
```

### Manual Build for Development (No coverage test)

If you prefer running steps manually, our repository follows a very standard CMake workflow, here is an example:

```bash
cmake -G Ninja -B build/debug -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug src
cd build/debug
ninja -j$(nproc)
ctest -j$(nproc)
```

### Testing and Verification

To run the full regression suite (build, test, and coverage) just like the CI server:

```bash
./run_regression.sh --coverage
```

By default, it will create `build/regression` directory.

### Installation

There is no standard installation step now, just copy the files in `src/fstcpp` to your project. If you want to use the C-style wrapper, also copy `src/gtkwave/fstapi.cpp` and `src/gtkwave/fstapi.h` to your project.

The dependencies are `ZLIB` and `lz4`, which are quite easy to install on most Linux distributions.
